# TITLE: Seven Segment display  Clock
This project aims,develop from zero,using authoral hardware and software. this marks hours,minutes and seconds using atmega328p microcontroller. It is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimal numerals.
# RESEARCH
OBJECTIVES:
The aim of the project is to form combinations of display numerical form 0 to 9 , that displays the time digitally.  seven segment digital  clock to display time in hours, minutes and seconds can be constructed.

FEATURES : 
It show up to 10 decimal digitals on a single display.
It is Interfaced able with almost every module.
          


# 4W's and 1'H

WHO:

•It has a requirements with different units and services.

WHEN:

• Remote controls generate invisible light.

WHERE:

•widely used in digital clocks,basic calculators,electronic meters etc.

HOW:

•this project takes in 0 to 9 values and yields out the  parameters.


## SWOT ANALYSIS

STRENGTH:

• It uses LED with traditional bulbs and lamps• Simple & Easy to Use

WEAKNESS:

•It display limited numbers like 0 to 9.

OPPURTUNITIES:

In future , more characters to be included.

THREATS:

 It forms alphabet A,B,C,D,E,F but It cannot form Alphabet like X and Z , so it cannot be used for alphabet.
